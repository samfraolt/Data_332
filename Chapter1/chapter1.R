1+1
# This command would print [1]2

#Exercise

#for this exercise I chose to use the number 100

#Addition: Add 2 to the number you chose
100+2
##102

#Multiply the result you find by 3
102*3
##306

#Subtract 6 from the result you find above
306-6
##300

#Divide the result you get by 3
300/3
##100

#To see how many numbers are between two values we use :
1:6
## 1 2 3 4 5 6

#Create an object named die that contains the numbers from 1 to 6
die<-1:6
## 1 2 3 4 5 6

# Now that we've named our function die we can do other operations such as
die-1
## 0 1 2 3 4 5
die/2
## 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0
die*die
## 1 4 9 16 25 36
